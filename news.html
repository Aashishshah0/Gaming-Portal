            <h3>Konami is Shutting Down CrimeSight</h3>
            <p>Konami announces its Sherlock inspired multiplayer-only social-deduction future-crime game CrimeSight is
                being shut down very soon</p>
            <img src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/crimesight-splashscreen.png?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5"
                alt="CrimeSight Splashscreen" class="img1">
            <p>In a recent announcement, Konami has revealed that they will be shutting down multiplayer social
                deduction game CrimeSight. While Konami seems to have recently been returning to typical game
                production, the announcement to shut down the servers was quite sudden</p>
            <p>A competitive mystery game, CrimeSight took place in London during the year 2075, when technology was
             Ssomewhat similar to Minority Report. The game was somewhat of an
                enigma when Konami randomly revealed CrimeSight in 2021. Then released on Steam for Microsoft Windows on
                April 14, 2022, but despite its intriguing premise, CrimeSight did not sell well.</p>
            <p>Konami has now announced via Steam and the CrimeSight Twitter account that the game’s service will be
                terminated May 1, 2023. One commenter on Twitter pointed out that the game was only able to last for one
                year and one month, expressing their disappointment that there will not be a chance to host private
                games. Other commenters expressed similar thoughts that the game itself was truly enjoyable and had a
                unique premise. Many games in the past have been able to overcome initial poor sales, but for an online
                game it is essential that the players keep active. Even games that sold better such as Marvel’s Avengers
                could not avoid shutting down when faced with waning player interaction</p>

            <p>CrimeSight didn't sell well, but it was an indicator that Konami was prepared to take risks with new
                ideas. With a history of games going as far back as 1977, Konami has been a big name in the industry for
                a long time. But as new IPs or new installments of their flagship titles started to reduce in the early
                2010s, fans’ opinions of the company grew more suspicious, especially as the focus seemed to shift
                toward a focus on Konami pachinko machines. From a western perspective, the decision seems completely
                bizarre, however in Konami’s home country of Japan, pachinko is a massive industry.</p>
            <p>Luckily for fans of Konami’s classic IPs, it seems as though the focus is returning to game production.
                With Konami observing the resurgence of popularity in Resident Evil since the very successful Resident
                Evil 2 remake, Konami seems to have realized the potential in its wealth of properties. The proof that
                fans are eager for this return can be seen in cases such as the Silent Hill 2 limited edition vinyl
                selling out in under 2 minutes</p>

            <h3>Nintendo Switch Online Game Vouchers May Be Returning</h3>
            <p>Nintendo Switch players looking for a good game deal may be able to look forward to the online service's
                game vouchers making a return</p>
            <img src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nintendo-switch-online-vouchers.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5"

            <p>Nintendo Switch gamers who are looking to play a game at a discount may be in luck, as hints have emerged
                at the possibility of Nintendo Switch Online vouchers returning. The leak could spell good news for
                fans, as first-party Switch games rarely go on sale under normal circumstances.</p>
            <p>Nintendo Switch Online vouchers were offered up until 2019, and were made exclusively available to those
                who subscribed to the Nintendo Switch Online service. The vouchers acted as an extra perk for
                subscribers, while also encouraging fans to pick up games they might not have otherwise, or were holding
                off on.</p>

            <p>The Nintendo Switch Online vouchers cost $99.98 for two, which can then be utilized in the Nintendo
                Switch eShop in exchange for two games. While spending a hundred dollars all at once might be a bit
                steep for some fans, there is a significant savings in doing so, as players will end up spending $100
                instead of $120 on two games, as they usually sell for $59.99 each. However, the base cost of the
                Nintendo Switch Online service is $20 a year, so players who aren't already subscribed may want to keep
                that in mind.</p>
            <p>The best thing about the Nintendo Switch Online vouchers in the past is that they weren't limited to very
                old games. The new promo seems to confirm this will the case once again, showing titles like Splatoon 3,
                Bayonetta 3, and even Pokemon Scarlet and Violet as potential games to redeem vouchers on</p>
            <p>For now, Nintendo Switch Online vouchers aren't available for purchase, but that could end up changing in
                the near future. Prior evidence has emerged that there may be a Nintendo Direct on the way that could
                highlight The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Although Zelda is likely to receive its own deep
                dive of a Nintendo Direct at some point prior to launch, a general Nintendo Direct could easily be the
                place that Nintendo chooses to reveal this offer</p>

            <h3>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2 Get New Update for January 30</h3>
            <p>Activision deploys a new patch for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Warzone 2 to combat
                bugs and crashes ahead of Season 2.</p>
            <img src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-warzone-2-get-new-update-january-30-gamerant-1.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5"
                alt="" class="img1">
            <p>With barely half a month left in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Warzone 2's Season 1, a
                new patch has been released. Relatively fresh off the release of Season 1 Reloaded, Activision is
                dedicated to polishing up Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 before the new season drops. This patch, while
                not adding anything from a gameplay perspective, offers a plethora of bug and crash fixes aimed at
                improving player satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Since the launch of Season 1 Reloaded back on December 14, 2022, players have been enjoying a fresh
                infusion of content in every game mode. From the deadly Building 21 to the improved maps in multiplayer,
                Season 1 Reloaded was the perfect addition to the game but also introduced various bugs and crashes. In
                the first patch of the new year, Activision managed to root out several of the annoying bugs and crash
                errors. Unsurprisingly, a few bugs did manage to survive, given how massive the Season 1 Reloaded patch
                was.</p>
            <p>The latest update for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Warzone 2 is mainly targeted at
                stabilizing the game. Outside the stability update, issues targeted in this patch include the Spotter
                Scope and the Sentry Gun not working as intended, various issues with knives in the Gunsmith menu,
                various UI and navigation fixes, and an issue some players were having with accessing and leaving the
                firing range</p>

            <p>Over on the Warzone 2 and DMZ side, the changes weren't too many for a change. The major bug that was
                causing players to lose their movement if they used a recon drone near water has been addressed and
                fixed. Several accessibility fixes have been performed regarding the insured slot. The insured slot will
                now correctly display the Gunsmith option for equipped launchers to change camos and will allow players
                to successfully navigate the insured slot menus. Faction mission screens have also been addressed, now
                displaying the correct rewards.</p>
            <p>The rest of the changes are addressed towards the entirety of the game. For the longest time, players
                have been bothered by a bunch of issues involving knives in the Gunsmith menu. Players couldn't apply
                camos to their custom knife blueprints and save different knife variants, with one particular bug
                kicking players out of the Gunsmith menu altogether while saving a custom knife. These issues have been
                addressed and fixed. This patch also brings a fix for the frustrating bug that caused players to crash
                if they dismissed a notification.</p>
            <p>The fixes introduced in this patch for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Warzone 2 are
                significant, but this might be the last patch for Season 1. Season 2 is slated for release on February
                15, and with any new release comes a wave of new bugs and stability issues. As the game is merely 15
                days away from the launch of a new season, players can expect the major patches to give way to smaller
                hotfixes for the most pressing issues.</p>

            <h3>Minecraft Adding Armor Customization in Upcoming Update</h3>
            <p>Mojang confirms that armor trims are coming to Minecraft as part of the 1.20 update, where players will
                have customization over their equipment.</p>
            <img src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Minecraft-Armorer.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5"
            alt="" class="img1">
            <p>Mojang has confirmed that armor customization is finally coming to Minecraft as part of the upcoming 1.20
                update. Fans have requested this update for years, and it looks like they'll finally have their wish
                when the update arrives in Minecraft sometime in the near future</p>
            <p>Since its release in 2011, developer Mojang has continued to release large updates at regular intervals.
                The last huge update, Minecraft 1.19, was titled The Wild Update and released in June 2022. The update
                featured a host of new mobs, biomes, blocks, and items that would give the game a new lease on life.
                While it's unknown if there are plans for a Minecraft sequel, if updates of this size continue, it can
                be assumed that it still has a long lifespan planned yet.</p>
            <p>In the images released on the official Minecraft website, players get an early glimpse of what the armor
                customization looks like. Initially, it will just be armor trims, adding simple designs to the formerly
                plain armor sets. Players have always been able to dye armor in Minecraft, but this update will take it
                to new heights. While the designs aren't the most intricate, it's still a step up in what players are
                able to use in-game currently, so any update is welcomed. Armor in Minecraft has always just been
                functional - now it can be fashionable, too</p>
            <img src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/minecraft-armour-trim.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5"
            alt="" class="img1">
            <p>The post describes in detail how players will be able to customize their armor. The trims come in 11
                different patterns, which players can dye in 10 different colors. The trims can only be used if the
                player hunts down a smithing template, which is a new ingredient that will be required for players to
                make smithing upgrades. Rather than simply adding the trims to the game, Mojang is weaving it with
                existing content, making it seem as though it's been part of the game all along. Players have long
                speculated about what the Minecraft 1.20 update would entail, and it's good to finally have a clearer
                picture, with more announcements surely on the way</p>
            <p>This update is a perfect example of why Minecraft continues to maintain hundreds of millions of active
                users over a decade since its release. Armor has long been a neglected part of the game, and rather than
                ignore the fans who wanted an update, Mojang has listened to them. They've done this consistently since
                2011, remaining on top of fan demands to make sure as much of the player base is as happy as possible.
                Obviously, they can't please everyone, but Mojang does a solid job of coming close.</p>
            <p>Minecraft is available now for Mobile, PC, PS4, Switch, Xbox One, and legacy platforms</p>

            <h3>Interesting Pokemon Fan Art Combines Pikachu With the Night Sky</h3>
            <p>A Pokemon fan and artist sketches a combination of Pikachu and the starry night sky by hand and posts
                their drawing on social media for all to see.</p>
            <img src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pokemon-pikachu-anime-cute.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5"
                alt="" class="img1">
            <p>A <i>Pokemon</i> fan and artist took inspiration from the night sky and combined it with Pikachu to
                create a work of art. When their sketch was complete, the artist posted their night sky Pikachu on
                Reddit, where they received compliments from other Pokemon fans for their creativity and art style.</p>
            <p>Known as the Mouse Pokemon, Pikachu has long been synonymous with the Pokemon franchise. Even as Ash and
                Pikachu are prepared to leave the Pokemon anime, that has not stopped fan artists from paying tribute to
                the Mouse Pokemon.</p>
